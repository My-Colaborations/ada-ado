Ada Database Objects

This Ada05 library provides object relational mapping
to access a database in Ada05.  Most of the concepts
developped for ADO come from the Java Hibernate ORM.

This library supports MySQL, Sqlite as databases.

Build with the following commands:

   ./configure
   make


The samples can be built using:

   gnatmake -Psamples
   
   
The unit tests are built using:

   gnatmake -Ptests


And unit tests are executed with:

   bin/ado_mysql_harness


Documentation

   The Ada Database Objects sources as well as a wiki documentation is provided on:

   http://code.google.com/p/ada-ado/



Database Drivers

   The MySQL and SQLite development headers and runtime are necessary for building
   the ADO driver.  The configure script will use them to enable the ADO drivers.

   MySQL Development installation

      sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev


   SQLite Development installation

      sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev


Database Creation

   Create the tests database by using the following command.
   Change 'root' and 'password' to a MySQL user that has admin access rights
   ('create database' and 'grant option' privileges).

      dynamo create-database db/regtests root password

   The default database connection string is defined in dynamo.xml.
   You can also specify the connection string and create the schema by using:

      dynamo create-database db/regtests 'mysql://localhost:3306/ado_test?user=ado' root password
