MySQL Notes

   Compilation with MySQL Windows libraries is not easy since the MySQL connector DLLs are
   not ready to use by GCC.   Since I've not found a clear way to make this work, this
   directory contains the DLLs and libraries that, after some hard work, were usable for me.

   The libmysql.a was generated by executing:

     reimp libmysql.dll

   The libmysql.dll should be copied in a bin directory (in the PATH).
   The libmysql.a and libmysql.lib should be copied in the GNAT lib directory.

   The MySQL dll files come from MySQL Connector 6.0.2.
   Download them at: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/


SQLite Notes
   The SQLite DLLs are provided for convenience (version 3070603).

   The files should be copied in a directory in the PATH.
